## 📖 **Introduction**

MobileForge is an open-source template builder designed to help developers create custom mobile app templates quickly and efficiently. Built with React Native and Expo for the frontend and powered by Supabase for backend services like database management, authentication, and storage, MobileForge offers flexibility and scalability while maintaining high standards for performance and code quality.
**Why Mobile Forge ?**
Unlike traditional templates, which are static and often lack flexibility, MobileForge lets you customize your setup based on your project’s needs. Whether it’s choosing your preferred code formatter, integrating specific backend services, or setting up internationalization, MobileForge ensures your app starts with the ideal foundation.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

Use the following command to get started quickly:

```bash
npx forge-expo-app
```

This will set up your project with the structure and configurations you choose. Here’s what the default structure looks like:

```
my-app/
├── .vscode/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── clients/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── navigation/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── context/
│   ├── screens/
│   ├── i18n/
│   ├── App.tsx
├── index.ts
├── eslintrc.config.mjs
├── .prettierrc
├── tsconfig.json
├── app.json
├── babel.config.ts
├── .env.example
├── .env.development
├── .env.test
├── .env.production
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── makefile
```

## 🦄 **Current Setups**

- **🛠️ Formatter Setup**: Ensure consistent code quality and readability with your preferred setup:
  - **Prettier + ESLint**: A powerful combination for linting and formatting JavaScript/TypeScript code.
  - **Biome**: An all-in-one solution for linting, formatting, and more.
- **📂 Project Structure**:

  - **Folder Structure**: Organized folder structure for scalability and maintainability.
  - **Aliases**: Simplified module imports with **aliases** to avoid relative paths and improve code clarity.

- **🌐 Environment Files & Makefile**: Configured environment files (`.env.example`, `.env.development`, `.env.test`, etc.) for different stages (development, stage, production), integrated with a **Makefile** to streamline environment setup and execution.

- **🌍 i18n Setup**: Easily initialize **internationalization (i18n)** for multilingual support, including **text localization** and **date formatting**.

## 🚧 **Roadmap**

- **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: Integration with **Supabase** to provide a fully managed backend solution for user management, database, and more.
- **Social Authentication**: Adding **Google** and **Apple** login for social authentication.
- **Your setups**: contact us for any idea !
